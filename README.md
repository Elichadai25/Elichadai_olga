## üìò Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **SQL Window Functions** through analytical queries on an employee dataset. Window functions allow us to perform calculations across rows that are related to the current row without collapsing the result set ‚Äî a powerful tool for analysis in modern data environments.

We used functions like `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and aggregate functions with `PARTITION BY` to explore comparisons, rankings, and trends in our data.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

We created a fictional **Employees** dataset containing the following fields:

| Column     | Description                    |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| emp_id     | Unique identifier for each employee |
| name       | Employee's name                |
| department | Department (HR, IT, Sales)     |
| salary     | Employee salary                |
| join_date  | The date the employee joined   |

This dataset provides a realistic structure to simulate common business scenarios in HR and analytics.

## üîç Tasks and Explanations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Compare Values with Previous or Next Records

**Functions used**: `LAG()`, `LEAD()`

**Objective**: Compare each employee‚Äôs salary to the previous and next employee's salary in the same department.

```sql
LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary)
LEAD(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary)
Explanation:

LAG() gets the previous row‚Äôs salary.

LEAD() gets the next row‚Äôs salary.

We used a CASE statement to label each comparison as HIGHER, LOWER, or EQUAL.

üí° Real-life Application: Useful in performance reviews to analyze if an employee‚Äôs salary is above or below their peers.

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ranking Data within a Category 

Functions used: RANK(), DENSE_RANK()

Objective: Rank employees by salary within each department.

sql
Copy
Edit
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
Explanation:

RANK() skips numbers if there are ties (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).

DENSE_RANK() does not skip numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 3).

üí° Real-life Application: Useful for promotions and performance-based bonus distribution.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Top 3 Salaries per Department

Functions used: DENSE_RANK()
Objective: Retrieve the top 3 highest-paid employees per department.

Explanation:

We ranked employees by salary within each department and filtered where rank ‚â§ 3.

Using DENSE_RANK() ensures employees with the same salary are treated equally.

üí° Real-life Application: Helps identify top performers in each team.

 4Ô∏è‚É£ Finding the Earliest Joiners

Functions used: ROW_NUMBER()

Objective: Retrieve the first 2 employees who joined in each department based on the join_date.

Explanation:

We ranked employees by join date using ROW_NUMBER() and selected the top 2.

ROW_NUMBER() is ideal when you want strictly the first N rows (no ties).

üí° Real-life Application: Useful for tracking employee tenure and celebrating milestones.

 5Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregation with Window Functions

Functions used: MAX() with OVER(PARTITION BY...) and OVER()

Objective:

Find the maximum salary in each department.

Also show the overall maximum salary in the entire company

Using PARTITION BY allows category-wise aggregation without grouping.

The overall max is applied across all rows.
MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department)
MAX(salary) OVER ()
Explanation:

Using PARTITION BY allows category-wise aggregation without grouping.

The overall max is applied across all rows.

üí° Real-life Application: Helps compare departmental performance with company-wide trends.

 ‚úÖ Learning Outcome

Through this assignment, we learned how to:

Use SQL Window Functions for advanced analytics.

Perform row-wise comparisons, rankings, and aggregations.

Understand the difference between RANK, DENSE_RANK, and ROW_NUMBER.

 üí° Real-World Application Examples

HR Analytics: Salary analysis, join-date trends, performance rankings.

Sales: Track sales volume compared to previous months, identify top sellers.

Education: Compare student test scores, rank within classes or semesters.

Finance: Track stock price changes day-by-day, compute max/min per sector.

 üßëüèΩ‚Äçü§ù‚ÄçüßëüèΩ Collaboration Summary

We worked collaboratively on:

Dataset design and population
Query writing and explanation
Documentation and GitHub version control
Both team members contributed equally. Our GitHub commit history reflects this.
